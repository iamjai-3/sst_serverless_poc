# Add Your Access Key to AWS CLI

We now need to tell the AWS CLI to use your Access Keys from the previous chapter.

It should look something like this:

- Access key ID AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
- Secret access key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
- Simply run the following with your Secret Key ID and your Access Key.

      aws configure
